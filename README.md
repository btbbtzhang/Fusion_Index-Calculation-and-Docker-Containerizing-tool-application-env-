# Fusion_Index Calculation and Docker Containerizing tool application env
To calculated the muscle fiber coverage and fusion index score (nuclear staining inside the fiber percentage) through microscopy images, I found a powerful well-trained DNN model that can be used for this purpose, the tool is called MyoFinDer. The objectives of this repository are:
(Ref: https://tissueengineeringlab.github.io/MyoFInDer/installation.html#1-on-windows)

## Aim 1:
To create a proper pipeline workflow for the application of MyoFinDer, so that it can be used for for the lab team daily usage.

## Aim 2:
After smoothly employed this tool, I need to containerize the applying env into a Docker container, so that other biologist can easily use it based on their skills.

Thus, this repository contains two parts.

## ðŸ“š Part 1: Tool applicaton, customized workflow and result samples.
